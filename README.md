Null values in column country were replaced by 'others'.
Null values in column children were replaced by the mean of the column.

(3) Converting columns to appropriate data types
Changed data type of children, company, agent to int type.
Changed data type of reservation_status_date to date type.

To discuss the analysis of given hotel bookings data set from 2015-2017.

Weâ€™ll be doing analysis of given data set in following ways :

Hotel wise analysis

Booking cancellation analysis

Hotel Wise Analysis
While doing univariate analysis of given hotel booking dataset, we answered following questions:

Which meal is preferred by most Customer?
Which Hotel is booked most?
From which country most of the customers are coming?

Booking Wise Analysis 
While doing booking analysis of given hotel booking dataset, we answered following questions:

Which hotel has higher bookings cancellation rate?
Which month have most Guest?
Which month is best for booking Hotel?
Which one is booking Hotel most(Single, Couple, Married)?


Bivariate Analysis :
We tried to answer following questions

Around 60% bookings are for City hotel and 40% bookings are for Resort hotel, therefore City Hotel is busier
than Resort hotel.

Most loving BB type food either from City or Resort Hotels.

Most of the guests came from european countries, with most no. of guest coming from Portugal.

Almost 30% of bookings are cancelled.

Most number of guest comes in month of August.

July- August are the most busier and profitable months for both of hotels.

Couples are the most common guests for hotels, hence hotels can plan services according to couples needs  to increase revenue.

And many more conclusions.
Challenges
(1) There was a lot of duplicate data.
(2) Data was present in wrong datatype format.
(3) Choosing appropriate visualization techniques to use was difficult.
(4) A lot of null values were there in the dataset.
